		<h2>Grab Wallet Chrome Extension</h2>
		<h3>Vote with your dollar</h3>
		<p>This extension uses the registry from <a href="https://grabyourwallet.org/">https://grabyourwallet.org/</a> to flag business websites that are associated with the Trump family's commercial activities.</p>
		<p>The tool is targeted towards those that do not want to further enrich the Trump family for a variety of reasons, including unprecedented conflicts of interest in America's top office and the fact that self-enrichment is arguably one of Trump's top priorities and therefore, one of the stronger levers available for collective resistance.</p>
		<p>Not shopping at these websites is only one of many possible ways to discourage companies from doing business with Trump.
